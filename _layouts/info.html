        <h2 id="title">About Me</h2>
        <p>Throughout my education I have experienced many team-based projects that will aid in my career as a designer. I have a strong understanding of the process designers must take such as research, conceptualizing, creative development, solutions, and presentations. Graphic design is something I am passionate about and feel strongly in. Some of my other strengths are: user interface design, design research, photo editing, game design, and web design. The design industry provides me with new and exciting challenges everyday that I can tackle. Having variety in my life is important to me and allows me to express myself in unique ways.<br>I take pride in my work and continuously push myself to further my skills and learn from my mistakes as well as others. For me design is so much more than something we look at, itâ€™s something we hear, touch, and interact with. Having the ability to create these experiences for users through the various forms of media inspires me on a daily basis. I will continue with my fascination to create new and exciting designs and experiences throughout many mediums.</p>
